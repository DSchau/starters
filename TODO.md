# Must haves

- Add ESLint support for starters
- Get secure way to publish read-only starters
  - Should just be generating a secure token and exposing it to CircleCI container
- Find best way to commit lock files
- Find best way to keep starters up to date (auto-merged greenkeeper PRs if status checks are passing?)

# Nice to haves

- Add markdown-magic support to automatically generate markdown documentation for starters/
  - and keep it up to date!
- Clone gatsbyjs/gatsby to test latest versions of starters
- Use gatsby-dev to --copy-all when testing
